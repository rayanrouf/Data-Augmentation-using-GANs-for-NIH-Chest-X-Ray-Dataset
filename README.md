This repository contains the implementation and training of deep learning models for the diagnosis of lung diseases using Chest X-ray images. The project utilizes a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) to augment the NIH Chest X-ray dataset and trains convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including MobileNet and InceptionResNetV2, to classify different lung conditions.

Project Structure:
CycleGAN_from_scratch.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the implementation of CycleGAN for data augmentation.
Training-mobilenet.ipynb: Jupyter notebook detailing the training process of the MobileNet model.
Training-resnet.ipynb: Jupyter notebook detailing the training process of the InceptionResNetV2 model.
augmented_image_paths.csv: A CSV file containing the file paths to the augmented images generated by CycleGAN.
mobilenet_roc.png: Image showing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the MobileNet model.
optimizer_selection.png: Image displaying the optimizer selection process.
sample_labels.csv: A CSV file listing sample labels for the images.
test.csv: A CSV file with test data details.
train.csv: A CSV file with training data details.
trained_img_predictions.png: Image showing predictions made by the MobileNet model on test images.
trained_img_predictions_resnet.png: Image showing predictions made by the InceptionResNetV2 model on test images.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Open the .ipynb notebooks in a Jupyter environment.
Run the notebooks to train the models or to generate augmented images with CycleGAN.
